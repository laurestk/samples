This is a collection of sound files obtained during field recording sessions at the CTI Renato Archer LAprint (3D Printing Open Lab) and LAimage (Imaging lab) at Campinas - SÃ£o Paulo - Brasil. 
The field recordings happened between the years of 2022 and 2023 while I was conducting experiments and fabricating parts at the laboratories.
